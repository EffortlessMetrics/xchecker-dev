# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This is a generated requirements document for spec embed-demo-run. The system will provide core functionality for managing and processing specifications through a structured workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate structured requirements from rough ideas, so that I can create comprehensive specifications efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a problem statement THEN the system SHALL generate structured requirements in EARS format
2. WHEN requirements are generated THEN they SHALL include user stories and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL produce both markdown and YAML artifacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deterministic output generation, so that I can reproduce results consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identical inputs are provided THEN the system SHALL produce identical canonicalized outputs
2. WHEN artifacts are created THEN they SHALL include BLAKE3 hashes for verification
3. WHEN the process runs THEN it SHALL create audit receipts for traceability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want atomic file operations, so that partial writes don't corrupt the system state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing artifacts THEN the system SHALL use atomic write operations
2. WHEN failures occur THEN partial artifacts SHALL be preserved for debugging
3. WHEN operations complete THEN all files SHALL be in a consistent state

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1 Performance:** The system SHALL complete requirements generation within reasonable time limits
**NFR2 Reliability:** All file operations SHALL be atomic to prevent corruption
**NFR3 Auditability:** All operations SHALL be logged with cryptographic verification
