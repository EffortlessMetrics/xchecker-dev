## Active Work

### v1.2.0 - Polish & Documentation

| Task | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Add `--llm-gemini-binary` CLI flag | High | Open |
| Config test environment isolation | Medium | Open |
| Hooks documentation in CONFIGURATION.md | Medium | Open |
| README update with V11-V14 completeness | Low | Open |

### v2.0.0 - Modularization

A major architectural refactoring to improve maintainability and enable independent crate development.

See **[plans/modularization-report.md](../plans/modularization-report.md)** for full details.

**Summary:**
- Split into 19 crates from current 4
- Extract CLI layer (5471 lines) into dedicated crate
- Decompose xchecker-engine into domain-specific crates
- Establish clear dependency hierarchy

**Proposed Crates:**
| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| xchecker-core | Foundation utilities |
| xchecker-runner | Process execution |
| xchecker-phases | Phase execution |
| xchecker-orchestrator | Workflow orchestration |
| xchecker-workspace | Multi-spec management |
| xchecker-fixup | Fixup detection/application |
| xchecker-status | Status queries |
| xchecker-gate | CI/CD gate enforcement |
| xchecker-templates | Template management |
| xchecker-doctor | Health diagnostics |
| xchecker-benchmark | Performance benchmarking |
| xchecker-hooks | Hook system |
| xchecker-validation | Validation logic |
| xchecker-extraction | Content extraction |
| xchecker-cli | CLI, TUI, error reporting |

## Design Principles

### Controlled Execution
- All LLM outputs go through FixupEngine + atomic write pipeline
- No direct file modification by LLM
- ExternalTool/agentic mode reserved for future versions

### Provider Abstraction
- Single `LlmBackend` trait hides transport details
- Orchestrator agnostic to CLI vs HTTP
- Easy to add new providers without changing orchestrator

### Cost Control
- OpenRouter: default budget 20 calls, configurable via `budget` or `XCHECKER_OPENROUTER_BUDGET`
- Exit code 70 if budget exceeded
- Doctor checks don't send HTTP requests (opt-in only)

### Compression for AI Agents
- Receipts and status JSON enable agents to work with minimal context
- Compact JSON shapes for spec, status, resume commands
- JCS canonical emission for reproducibility

## Historical Context

The V11–V18 roadmap was originally planned as an 8-phase, 15–23 week effort spanning multi-provider LLM support and ecosystem features. Implementation was completed ahead of schedule with all planned features shipping in v1.1.0.

**Original Timeline (November 2025):**
- V11-V14: LLM backend abstraction and providers
- V15: Claude Code integration (compressed JSON shapes)
- V16: Workspace orchestration
- V17: Policy gates
- V18: Templates and hooks

**Actual Delivery:**
- v1.0.0 (December 2025): Core runtime
- v1.1.0 (January 2026): All V11-V18 features

**Status**: Active roadmap - v1.1.0 released, v2.0.0 modularization in planning
